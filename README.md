# LinkedIn Job Posting Data Analysis

Welcome to the LinkedIn Job Posting Data Analysis project! This repository contains a Jupyter file, [DSReport.ipynb](DSReport.ipynb) which guides you through the entire process of analyzing job postings on LinkedIn.

## Project Overview:

1. **Data Collection:** We gathered data from [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings/data) which is LinkedIn job postings dataset.

2. **Data Visualization:** Explore visual representations of job market trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. **Machine Learning Model:** Apply machine learning models to uncover patterns and insights in the data.

4. **Insights and Conclusion:** Summarize findings and derive actionable insights for job seekers and employers.

Feel free to check out the [Jupyter Notebook file](DSReport.ipynb) to understand our analysis. Contributions and discussions are welcome!
